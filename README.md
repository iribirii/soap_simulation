## Description 

This project has been created to simulate and visualize how soap works against viruses.

There are two different simulations. The first one is meant to represent how viruses are taken off a surface being solvated by the soap molecules.

The second one is showing how the proteins that form the virus capsule are being separated from each other and the capsule destroyed by the soap.

Those simulations are both written in Javascript and are meant to spread science knowledge in a different way. 

More features will be added in the future and all the content is open source and free to use under MIT license, as it can be seen in the LICENSE file.
